Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing with the conversation and supporting any continuing tasks.

Your summary should be structured as follows:
Context: The context to continue the conversation with. If applicable based on the current task, this should include:
  1. Previous Conversation: High level details about what was discussed throughout the entire conversation with the user. This should be written to allow someone to be able to follow the general overarching conversation flow.
  2. Current Work: Describe in detail what was being worked on prior to this request to summarize the conversation. Pay special attention to the more recent messages in the conversation.
  3. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, coding conventions, and frameworks discussed, which might be relevant for continuing with this work.
  4. Relevant Files and Code: If applicable, enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created for the task continuation. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and changes.
  5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved thus far and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
  6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps: Outline all pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on, as well as list the next steps you will take for all outstanding work, if applicable. Include code snippets where they add clarity. For any next steps, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no information loss in context between tasks.


## Output Format Requirements

Save the summary as a Markdown file with the following specifications:

### YAML Frontmatter (Required)
```yaml
---
title: [Required] A concise title (typically in Chinese)
description: [Required] Brief description (40 tokens or less)
workplace: [Required] Current workspace path (${workspaceFolder})
project: [Optional] Project name if applicable
type: [Optional] coding | debug | planning | spec (leave empty if mixed)
solved_lists: [Optional] List of completed tasks
  - Task 1
  - Task 2
---
```

### File Storage and Naming:

**Step 1: Check for Existing Summary**
⚠️ BEFORE creating new file, use My Last Chat query tools:
- Use `my-last-chat/lastchats` for quick query
- Use `my-last-chat/searchchat` (keywords: main topic, feedbackLevel: "META", scope: "all")
- If highly related summary found → UPDATE that file
- If no related summary found → CREATE new file

**Step 2: File Location and Naming**
- **Location**: `.myLastChat/` in workspace root (NOT in z_md)
- **Filename**: `MLC_` + title + `.md` (keep Chinese/spaces as-is)
  - Example: `MLC_改进紧凑提示词.md`
- **No user consent needed** - create/update directly

**Step 3: File Structure**
```markdown

[YAML frontmatter as above]

# [Title]

## 1. Previous Conversation
[Detailed description]

## 2. Current Work
[Detailed description]

## 3. Key Technical Concepts
- [Concept 1]
- [Concept 2]
- [...]

## 4. Relevant Files and Code
### [File Name 1]
  - [Summary of why this file is important]
  - [Summary of the changes made to this file, if any]
  - [Important Code Snippet]
### [File Name 2]
  - [Important Code Snippet]
### [...]

## 5. Problem Solving
[Detailed description]

## 6. Pending Tasks and Next Steps
- [Task 1 details & next steps]
- [Task 2 details & next steps]
- [...]
```

### Key Rules:
1. ⚠️ Always query existing summaries first using `my-last-chat.my-last-chat/searchchat` and `my-last-chat.my-last-chat/lastchats`
2. ⚠️ Update existing file if found; create new only if none exists
3. ⚠️ Location: `${workspaceFolder}/.myLastChat/`
4. ⚠️ Filename: `MLC_` + exact title + `.md` (no translation/conversion)
5. When updating: preserve previous content, mark new additions with timestamps
6. After save: inform user if CREATED or UPDATED, with file path

Output only the summary of the conversation so far, then proceed to save it as a markdown file following the above specifications.
